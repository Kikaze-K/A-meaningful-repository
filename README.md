# A meaningful repository I found
It is a repository about COVID-19, which nearly everyone on the earth is concerning about.
This writer (or writers? I'm not sure) collect data about COVID-19, including:
* confirmed cases
* deaths
* testing

And I can see that the writer has just updated 5 hours ago.

Though the data collected seem to mainly comes from ECDC (the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control), I regard this work meaningful.
Because it is a kind of record and provides an easy way for people to approach a lot of data.
